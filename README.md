#ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon!

  About: I am currently a junior in University studying Computer Science with a concentration in computational intelligence. I work in the financial industry but will be looking to break into the tech field once I graduate. 
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing my skills in multiple programming languages from front-end developing to back-end developing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. After more of a mastery I will be pursuing Kotlin and Ruby.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really enjoy reading books, exercising, and learning new languages (currently speak English, Spanish, German and am currently learning French).
